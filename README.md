## 📄 Project Overview
This dashboard analyzes several months of my personal transaction data to answer key questions about how and where I spend my money.  
It focuses on the following areas:
- **Monthly spending trends** and how they change over time.
- **Category breakdown** to see which areas dominate my budget.
- **Top vendors** where most spending is concentrated.
- **Weekday vs weekend** behavior differences.
- **Projection** of future spending if current trends continue.
- **Cumulative spend curve** to visualize spending build-up over time.

The aim is to turn raw transaction data into a **decision-making tool**, helping identify spending habits, set budgets, and highlight areas for change.
